This repository was built following the instructions from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css). 

With this curriculum, I'm learning how to use Git and GitHub, and the command line.
This project make me work on my HTML and CSS skills.
