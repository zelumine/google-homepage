This repository was built following the instructions from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css). 

With this curriculum, I'm also learning how to use Git and GitHub, and the command line.

This project made me work on my HTML and CSS skills (and struggle with flexboxes, but I managed to make it look as I wanted!).

I chose to use flexboxes for the positionning. I tried to make it look like Google's homepage as much as possible. I also made it responsive.
